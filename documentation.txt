Hooks:

With jquery when we create counter function 

let counter =1;

onclick value will increase by 1

then counter = counter + 1;

But react its not working because dom is not updated and in jquery variable is increased so for this reason we have to learn hooks.

Another example facebook:

In facebook show message count on chatbox,top bar and all palace.
