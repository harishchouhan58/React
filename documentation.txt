Hooks:

With jquery when we create counter function 

let counter =1;

onclick value will increase by 1

then counter = counter + 1;

But react its not working because dom is not updated and in jquery variable is increased so for this reason we have to learn hooks.

Another example facebook:

In facebook show message count on chatbox,top bar and all palace.


In this we have this problem variable is changed on click but UI is not updated so react allow to update UI by using its hook.


JS updated variable but for ui update we have to use react and react provide hooks for that functioanlity
